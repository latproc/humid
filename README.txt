Humid is a GUI Editor and GUI generator using nanogui.

Humid is primarily intended for use with Clockwork Language
systems (https://github.com/latproc/clockwork).

This is a *work in progress* and still requires significant work.

The general idea is that humid drives a display that can switch
between various 'screens'. Individual fields and buttons on these
screens can be linked to properties within machines within a
clockwork system so that clockwork can control the GUI.

## Branches

The most stable and conservative branch is 'production' whereas
the master branch has many bug fixes and feature improvements.
Most production systems in operation at present use the
production branch but don't rely on the interactive editor
since it is fairly flakey. It turns out that if screen files
are edited by hand or generated by programs, the production
branch of humid is ok to drive screens and talk to clockwork.



Thanks for taking the time to look at this project, I hope
to make it more reliable and accessible in the near future.
