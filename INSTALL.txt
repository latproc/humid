To build this project:

  git clone https://github.com/latproc/humid.git
  cd humid
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  cd lib/nanogui
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  cd ../..
  make debug

The built programs will be in build/Debug.

To run humid or the examples, first cd to the build directory:

  cd build/Debug
  ./humid

NanoGUI examples are also built and can be run from the same 
directory.

There is not install process yet as this is still a work in progress.
